The robot uses an Arduino Nano Every.  
A 2600mAh 11.7V LiPo battery supplies the power.
A L298N is used as the esc for the motor. 

The sensors used are as follows: 
  3x VL53L0X time of flight sensors. 
  1x MPU6050 Gyroscope + Accelerometer. 

 

The time-of-flight sensors were chosen because they have a decent range and high precision when compared to other types of sensors that can be used to measure distance. 
The distances they record are the main tool used to ensure the robot drives as intended and turns when intended. 
The gyroscope is used to aid the time-of-flight sensors in ensuring the robot drives in a straight line and turns precisely.
